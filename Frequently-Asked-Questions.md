Q: Why can users not break or build in the wilderness outside of their towns?

A: Read the [opening paragraphs of the nodes page.](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/Towny-Permission-Nodes)

Q: When towns fall or unclaim land all the blocks start to disappear back into wilderness. How do I stop this?

A: Using `/tw toggle revertunclaim` in each world. 

> - The New World Settings section of the [config](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/Default-Config.yml) is only default settings for new worlds, it's explained in the config section comments, the [install guide](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/Installation#configuring-existing-worlds) and the [how towny works](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works#reverting-unclaimed-townblocks-to-their-original-state-on-unclaim) page. You need to be using the /tw toggle commands or manually setting the worldname.txt file.
