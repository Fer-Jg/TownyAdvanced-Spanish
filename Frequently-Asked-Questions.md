Q: Why doesn't my dynmap show towns?

A: The newest version of Dynmap-Towny 0.81 requires the use of a Towny pre-release version 0.96.2.5 or newer. If you don't want to use the Towny pre-releases and stay on 0.96.2.0 you must use [Dynmap-Towny 0.80.](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Dynmap-Towny/releases/tag/0.80)
