The documentation found on the [Towny Wiki](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki) is updated every time a Release version of Towny is put out. If you are using a development build it is expected that you have read the changelog for any important changes since the previous Release build.

Some important pages to look over:
- [Installing Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/Installation)
- [How Towny Works](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/How-Towny-Works)
