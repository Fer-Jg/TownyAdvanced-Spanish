The Dynmap & TownyDynmap plugins are the only map plugins officially compatible with Siege-War.  Plugins which can reveal the otherwise tactically-hidden map positions of enemy players are not compatible.


Some Non-Towny plugins may allow players to TP into a siegezone.  (e.g. sethome).  Unfortunately Towny cannot reliably prevent this, thus it is recommended to either disable these plugins, or try to configure them in such a way that it does not heavily impact warfare.


Sometimes towns with an extremely high bank balance are known to become unsiegable. This bug will be looked at / fixed.
