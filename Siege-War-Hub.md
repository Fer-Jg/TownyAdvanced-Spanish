Hello!

**INTRODUCTION**

As promised a few weeks ago, the following is a PR for a new optional war system,
called 'Siege War'.

Briefly who I am: A professional programmer, huge Towny fan, and huge far of virtual waaaaar! :-)

**FEATURE SUMMARY**

So on to the feature.  
How does it work ? 

- Siege War is a non-destructive, war-on-demand system, focusing on geo-politics.

- In comparison to the 'Event War' system, which works very well as a visceral and destructive "Battle Royale" occasion, and 'Flag War' which also tends to be more short-term and destructive, Siege War is a more strategic & political option. The system is completely non-destructive to buildings, because town build perms are completely unaffected. Towns can only be captured in their entirety, leaving the mayor in place, and casting the victorious nation as an 'occupying power'. 

- Another key aspect of Siege War is its appeal to "casual" and "cross-timezone" player bases.  Each siege is typically of a moderate duration (e.g. 3 days), which may seem an unusual feature at first glance, but has the advantage of allowing both 'dedicated' and  'casual/cross-timezone' players to become involved and contribute meaningfully to most wars. 

- Siege War also provides a 'Peacefulness' mechanic, allowing towns to become immune to all material war costs (e.g. pvp, plunder and taxes). These towns can still be captured, but the occupation is in-name-only.

- It is envisaged that this new option will be particularly appealing to:
1. Servers who would like their players to "Build an empire", and/or "conquer the world".
2. Servers who like the idea of a war system, but are reluctant to enable anything that would damage existing settlements or structures.
3. Servers who have many casual players who drop in for a few hours a week, who would enjoy getting involved in a war, but don't have capacity to arrange involvement in an organised event.
4. Servers which are international, with many cross-timezone players.

**CASE STUDIES OF SERVERS**

1. https://earthmc.net/   --- A "geopolitical sandbox server", which encourages players to "Form your own town, join a nation and conquer earth!". Currently not using any war system. Siege War is ideally suited to strategic geopolitics, and facilitating imperial conquest.
2. https://minesuperior.com/ --- A popular TownyServer which I have played much, which is filled with great towns and landmarks. Many nations exist, but these are often treated as just an easy way to get extra town blocks. Siegewar could be suitable to deploy, as it would restore the importance of Nations and perhaps facilitate more community engagement (which is applicable to many servers).

**MECHANICS**

- The mechanics of SiegeWar are quite straightforward. Here are the basics:

1. Start a Siege:   Place a coloured banner next to an enemy town.
2. Score Siege Points - Banner Control:   As an attacker or defender, score siege points by  occupying the wilderness area close to the siege-banner for 10 mins, thus 'capturing' the banner, and getting automatic point increases after that.
3. Score Siege Points - Kill:  As an attacker or defender, score siege points by killing enemy players in a wide radius around the the siege banner.
4. Win Siege:   When the siege-victory-timer hits 0, the side with the best siege-points total wins.
5. Plunder Town:   If the attacker has won, they may place a chest outside the the town. This will 'plunder' the town of X gold, and transfer the loot to the victorious nation. Towns which run out of money will go 'bankrupt', where perms are still protected, but the town is in debt.
6. Capture Town:   If the attacker has won, they may place a second coloured banner outside  the town. This will capture the town, and forcibly add it to the victorious nation.

**EXAMPLE OF A SIEGE**

1. For ages, the nation of the Stone Dwarves has eyed with greed the fertile lands of the Elven Woodland realm, across the river.
2. A new king, Skullsplitter101, has recently ascended to the Granite throne, and now in the great hall he steels his troops for war.
3. With banners ready, and diamond weapons sharp, 10 dwarves emerge from their capital and march across the river, stopping at the cut stone walls of the town of Woodlandia.
4. With one swift action, Skullsplitter 101 takes out a banner, and plants the banner outside the walls. A global message goes out - A siege has begun!.
5. T+5 minutes: BATTLE!!! The citizens of woodlandia  rush to action. 3 players in the town immediately rush to attack the dwarves. They fight bravely but are cut down.
6. The elves fall back and regroup
7. T+10 minutes: the dwarves, having established a good points difference, feel that this will be a walkover. They appoint one player as a 'loose sentry', who will occasionally check on the siege zone, while the other dwarves go back to building and trading.
8. T+2 hours:  the elves have finally organized a group of 5 players to repel the dwarves, and march to the siege zone. They find it unoccupied and secure the area.
9. T+3 hours: The sentry returns, surveys the area and raises the alarm. 6 dwarves march to the siege zone.
10. T+3 hours: CLOSE BATTLE!!!. A furious battle results in many casualties, and the elves are driven off. Both sides retired for the day
11. T+5-11 hours: Some casual players come and go, with many minor battles at the siegezone. Generally the dwarves hold
12. T+1 day:  This is a day for diplomacy, with Elvish envoys sent far and wide for reinforcements.
Eventually the Kingdom of Necromancers answer the call and agrees to come.
13. T+2 days Early:  EASY BATTLE!!! Finally the defenders are ready to strike back.   The Elves and Necromancers group up and at a set time, 8 players charge into the siege zone. 3 dwarves are butchered like hogs and the alliance secures the area.
14. T+2 days Late:  DECISIVE BATTLE!!! The dwarvish counterrattack comes in force, but it is too late. The Elves and Necromancers have overcome the previous points difference, hold firm, and are victorious!.
15. T+3 days:  As secretly agreed previously, the Elves then accept a handful of rings from the Necromancers...but that's a different story....
